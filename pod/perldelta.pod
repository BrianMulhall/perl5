=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.27.10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.27.9 release and the 5.27.10
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.27.8, first read
L<perl5279delta>, which describes differences between 5.27.8 and 5.27.9.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

L<Carp> has been upgraded from version 1.46 to 1.4x.

XXX Please update the version number.

L<Carp>, when generating stack traces, now attempts to work around
longstanding bugs resulting from Perl's non-reference-counted stack.
[perl #52610]

Carp has been modified to avoid assuming that objects cannot be
overloaded without the L<overload> module loaded (this can happen with
objects created by XS modules).  Previously, infinite recursion would
result if an XS-defined overload method itself called Carp.  [perl #132828]

Carp now avoids using C<overload::StrVal>, partly because older versions
of L<overload> (included with perl 5.14 and earlier) load L<Scalar::Util>
at run time, which will fail if Carp has been invoked after a syntax error.

including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

XXX New or changed warnings emitted by the core's C<C> code go here.  Also
include any changes in L<perldiag> that reconcile it to the C<C> code.

=head2 Changes to Existing Diagnostics

=item *

The new (as of 5.27.8) restriction forbidding use of C<goto> to enter the
argument of a binary or list expression (see L<perldiag/"Can't
E<quot>gotoE<quot> into a binary or list expression">) has been relaxed to
allow entering the I<first> argument of an operator that takes a fixed
number of arguments, since this is a case that will not cause stack
corruption.  [perl #132854]

=item *

The warning added in 5.27.8 concerning UTF-8 locale compatibility was
misleading.  The new wording and explanation are at
L<perldiag/Locale '%s' contains (at least) the following characters which
have unexepected meanings: %s  The Perl program will use the exepected
meanings>

=head1 Utility Changes

XXX Changes to installed programs such as F<perlbug> and F<xsubpp> go here.
Most of these are built within the directory F<utils>.

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

XXX Changes to F<Configure>, F<installperl>, F<installman>, and analogous tools
go here.  Any other changes to the Perl build process should be listed here.
However, any platform-specific changes should be listed in the
L</Platform Support> section, instead.

[ List changes as an =item entry ].

=over 4

=item *

F<lib/unicore/mktables> now correctly canonicalizes the names of the
dependencies stored in the files it generates.

F<regen/mk_invlists.pl>, unlike the other F<regen/*.pl> scripts, used
C<$0> to name itself in the dependencies stored in the files it
generates.  It now uses a literal so that the path stored in the
generated files doesn't depend on how F<regen/mk_invlists.pl> is
invoked.

This lack of canonical names could cause test failures in
F<t/porting/regen.t>.  [perl #132925]

must call it like C<Perl_langinfo(RADIXCHAR)>.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
